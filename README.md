## During the Internship, I worked on the following Projects: 

- **Blindness Detection -** Detected **Blindness** by creating an **Automated Analysis System** capable of assigning a **Score** based on the Scale [0-4] with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**, **PIL**, and others.

- **Gold Price Prediction -** Predicted **Price of the Gold** using **Random Forest** regression ML model with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**, and others.

- **House Price Prediction -** Predicted **Price of the House** using **Linear**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** regression ML models with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**, and others.

- **Personality Prediction -** Predicted **Personality via CV Analysis** using **XGBoost** regression ML model for **MBTI** dataset with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**, and others.
